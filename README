Overview
========

apply-rbd-diff applies an RBD diff stream to an ordinary volume. It has
been written to have minimal dependencies, so it can simply be copied
onto any recent (2008 or newer) system with Perl installed and run.

For full documentation and usage information, refer to the POD
documentation within the script itself. It may be read using perldoc:

  perldoc -T apply-rbd-diff
